# How to install RStudio on Ubuntu 20.04 step by step instructions
# First, we need to install all prerequisites. Open up a terminal and enter:
sudo apt update -y

echo "start install r"
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends r-base gdebi-core
echo "done install r"

# Next, download the Rstudio *.deb package from the official Rstudio website.
# Head for the most recent Ubuntu release available,
# meaning if the Ubuntu 20 - focal package is not available,
# download the Ubuntu 18 - bionic version. Example of downloaded package:

echo "start download r-studio"
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-ide-build/desktop/jammy/amd64/rstudio-2022.07.3-582-amd64.deb
echo "done download r-studio"

# Use the gdebi command to install the previously downloaded package.
# The gdebi command will ensure that all additional prerequisites
# are also downloaded to fulfil the RStudio requirements:
# Gdebi is a light-weight app that helps you install deb files more effectively by handling dependencies.
# If you use Ubuntu you might be using the Software Center to install .deb executable files.
# Ubuntu Software Center is heavy. It may be good for finding application but it certainly is not worth
# using just for installing a .deb file.
#
# Once upon a time, Ubuntu used archive manager for installing .deb files but
# now Software Center is the default application for installing DEB files.
# if you are just trying to install a .deb file in Ubuntu,
# I would not recommend using the Software Center. Itâ€™s an overkill and waste of resources.
# I recommend using GDebi, a dedicated program for installing Debian executable files.
# It is lightweight and focused on installing .deb files.
sudo gdebi rstudio-2022.07.3-582-amd64.deb

# Use your desktop menu to start the RStudio application.
